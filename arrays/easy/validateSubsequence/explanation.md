- Main explanation

Create a pointer that points to the first element of the array, in this case the name will be "j".
Create a pointer that points to the first element of the sequence, in this case the name will be "i".

while i and j are less than array and sequence length then
  if array in index j is equal to sequence in index i then
    increment the value of i
    
  in each iteration we will increase the value of j

if i is equal than sequence length then we have found a valid subsequence else not.
